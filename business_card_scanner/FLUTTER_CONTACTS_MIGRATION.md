# Flutter Contacts Migration Guide

## Overview

The Business Card Scanner app has been migrated from `contacts_service` and `permission_handler` to `flutter_contacts` for better iOS contact permission handling and improved cross-platform compatibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Updated

**Before:**
```yaml
dependencies:
  contacts_service: ^0.6.3
  permission_handler: ^12.0.0+1
```

**After:**
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_contacts: ^1.1.9+2
```

### 2. Contact Service Rewritten

The `ContactService` class has been completely rewritten to use `flutter_contacts` API:

#### Key Improvements:
- **Simplified Permission Handling**: `flutter_contacts` handles iOS permissions internally
- **Better iOS Compatibility**: Proper handling of iOS contact permission states
- **Unified API**: Single package for both contacts and permissions
- **Enhanced Contact Creation**: Support for more contact fields including websites and notes

#### New Methods:
- `hasContactsPermission()` - Check if permission is granted
- `requestContactsPermission()` - Request permission (returns boolean)
- `testContactsAccess()` - Test if contacts can be accessed
- `addToContacts(BusinessCard)` - Add business card to contacts
- `getAllContacts()` - Get all contacts for testing

### 3. iOS Permission Configuration

The iOS `Info.plist` already includes the required permission:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs contacts access to save business card information to your contacts</string>
```

### 4. Contact Permission Test Page Updated

The test page has been simplified to work with the new boolean-based permission system:

- Removed complex permission status handling
- Simplified UI with clear permission states
- Better error handling and user feedback

## How Flutter Contacts Improves iOS Permissions

### 1. Native iOS Permission Handling

`flutter_contacts` uses native iOS APIs that properly handle:
- Initial permission requests
- Permission denied states
- App settings integration
- iOS 14+ privacy features

### 2. Simplified Permission Flow

**Old Flow (contacts_service + permission_handler):**
1. Check permission status
2. Handle multiple permission states (denied, permanently denied, restricted, etc.)
3. Request permission separately
4. Handle different outcomes
5. Manually open app settings for permanently denied

**New Flow (flutter_contacts):**
1. Call `FlutterContacts.requestPermission()`
2. Returns `true` if granted, `false` if denied
3. iOS handles the permission dialog automatically
4. User can grant permission in Settings if needed

### 3. Better Contact Creation

The new implementation supports more contact fields:
- **Names**: First and last name parsing
- **Organizations**: Company and job title
- **Phones**: With proper labels (work, home, etc.)
- **Emails**: With proper labels
- **Addresses**: With proper labels
- **Websites**: Full URL support (temporarily disabled due to type issues)
- **Notes**: Additional information

## Usage Examples

### Basic Permission Check
```dart
final contactService = ContactService();
final hasPermission = await contactService.hasContactsPermission();
```

### Request Permission
```dart
final contactService = ContactService();
final granted = await contactService.requestContactsPermission();
if (granted) {
  // Permission granted, can add contacts
} else {
  // Permission denied, show explanation
}
```

### Add Business Card to Contacts
```dart
final contactService = ContactService();
try {
  await contactService.addToContacts(businessCard);
  // Success - contact added
} catch (e) {
  // Handle error (permission denied, invalid data, etc.)
}
```

## Testing

Use the Contact Permission Test page to verify functionality:
1. Navigate to Settings → Contact Permission Test
2. Check permission status
3. Request permission if needed
4. Test contact access
5. Add a test contact

## iOS-Specific Considerations

### 1. Permission Timing
- iOS shows permission dialog on first request
- Subsequent requests return cached result
- User must manually enable in Settings if denied

### 2. Contact Access Levels
- iOS may grant limited access (iOS 14+)
- `flutter_contacts` handles this automatically
- App works with both full and limited access

### 3. Privacy Features
- iOS 14+ includes enhanced privacy controls
- Users can grant limited contact access
- App gracefully handles all permission levels

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues
1. Check iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Contacts
2. Ensure app is listed and enabled
3. Restart app after changing permissions

### Contact Not Appearing
1. Check if contact was actually created
2. Verify contact app is syncing
3. Check if contact has required fields (name, phone, or email)

### Build Issues
1. Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
2. Update iOS deployment target if needed
3. Check Xcode project settings

## Migration Benefits

1. **Simplified Codebase**: Removed complex permission handling logic
2. **Better iOS Support**: Native iOS permission handling
3. **Enhanced Features**: Support for more contact fields
4. **Future-Proof**: Active maintenance and iOS updates
5. **Unified API**: Single package for contacts and permissions

## Next Steps

1. Test on physical iOS devices
2. Verify permission flow works correctly
3. Re-enable website functionality after resolving type issues
4. Consider adding contact editing capabilities
5. Implement contact synchronization features
